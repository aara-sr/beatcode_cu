# beatcode_cu

"initial commit" contains almost the final prototype of our project.
nodejs and python are used for this project. \n
install nodejs from https://nodejs.org/en/download. \n
use only python 3.11 to run this project. \n
for some reason only the env we created works for the backend so we have uploaded the env as well. "cd backend", activate env and run "uvicorn main:app --reload" to start the backend. \n
in another command shell, "cd frontend" run "npm run dev" to start the frontend. \n
go to https://localhost:3000 to access the site.
