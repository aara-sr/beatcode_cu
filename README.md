# beatcode_cu

"initial commit" contains almost the final prototype of our project.
nodejs and python are used for this project. <br><br>
install nodejs from https://nodejs.org/en/download. <br><br>
use only python 3.11 to run this project. <br><br>
for some reason only the env we created works for the backend so we have uploaded the env as well. "cd backend", activate env and run "uvicorn main:app --reload" to start the backend. <br><br>
in another command shell, "cd frontend" run "npm run dev" to start the frontend. <br><br>
go to https://localhost:3000 to access the site.
